# IMDB-Movie-Analysis

In this project, you have been presented with a dataset comprising various columns of information from different movies listed on IMDb. The task at hand is to frame a problem that can be addressed using this dataset. Once the problem is defined, it is recommended to clean the data as necessary, ensuring that it is accurate, consistent, and devoid of any irrelevant or erroneous entries.

After the data cleaning phase, you can leverage your data analysis skills to explore the dataset and extract meaningful insights. This involves examining relationships, patterns, and trends within the data to gain a deeper understanding of the movies and their associated attributes. By applying root cause analysis, a methodology developed by Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota Industries, you can identify the underlying factors contributing to specific outcomes or issues within the dataset. This process will help you uncover the fundamental reasons behind observed patterns or problems, enabling you to develop targeted solutions or strategies.

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to utilize the IMDb dataset, along with data analysis and root cause analysis techniques, to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions or recommendations related to the movie industry.
